      The show reference space. This is a sensor referred linear representation
      of the scene with primaries that correspond to scanned film. 0.18 in this
      space corresponds to a properly exposed 18% grey card.

      lg10 converts from scanned film to the show linear reference space. This
      is a custom conversion based on several Kodak acquisition stocks. All
      three color channels have the same response and there is no cross talk.
      This transform has a shoulder and toe compensation. This 10bit uiint
      version is used for DI deliveries.

      Converts from scanned film to the show linear reference space. This is a
      custom curve based on several Kodak acquisition stocks. All three color
      channels have the same response and there is no cross talk. This
      transform has a shoulder and toe compensation. This floating point
      version of the conversion that includes a large range of over-shoot and
      under-shoot values. This allows for colortiming offsets to be applied
      and reversed out losslessly. For internal use only.

      vd8 is an 8 bit sRGB like,2.2 gamma, conversion to and from the reference
      colorspace. This is a 1-d representation does not include any subtractive
      color mixing or crosstalk compensation. This is commonly used to
      interchange files between internal and external vendors. This is used as
      the interchange space for final images on direct to video or television
      products.
