        <description>lg10 converts from scanned film to the show linear reference space. This is a custom conversion based on several Kodak acquisition stocks. All three color channels have the same response and there is no cross talk. This transform has a shoulder and toe compensation. This 10bit uiint version is used for DI deliveries.</description>

        <description>Converts from scanned film to the show linear reference space. This is a custom curve based on several Kodak acquisition stocks. All three color channels have the same response and there is no cross talk. This transform has a shoulder and toe compensation. This floating point version of the conversion that includes a large range of over-shoot and under-shoot values. This allows for colortiming offsetsto be applied and reversed out losslessly. For internal use only. </description>

        <description>vd8 is an 8 bit sRGB like,2.2 gamma, conversion to and from the reference colorspace. This is a 1-d representation does not include any subtractive color mixing or crosstalk compensation. This is commonly used to interchange files between internal and external vendors. This is used as the interchange space for final images on direct to video or television products. </description>
