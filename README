Welcome!

OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a new open source project from Sony Imageworks.  Based on development started in 2003, OCIO enables color transforms and image display to be handled in a consistent manner across multiple graphics applications. Unlike other color management solutions, OCIO is geared towards motion-picture post production, with an emphasis on visual effects and animation color pipelines.

This forum is geared towards those interested in contributing (or just keeping tabs on) the library's development process.

Note: The current code is undergoing active development - hence the 0.5 version number - so we do not yet recommend using it in active production.
Our timeline is to get a stable, feature complete alpha version in September 2010, and to have polished library (1.0) ready for January 2011.
