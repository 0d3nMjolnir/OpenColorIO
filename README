Welcome!

OpenColorIO (OCIO) enables color transforms and image display to be handled in a consistent manner across multiple graphics applications. Unlike other color management solutions, OCIO is geared towards motion-picture post production, with an emphasis on visual effects and animation color pipelines.

All development discussion should be targeted to the google group: http://groups.google.com/group/ocio-dev

Tagged .tgz releases will be posted to the downloads section on a semi-regular basis.

Note: The current code is undergoing active development - hence the 0.5 version number - so we do not yet recommend using it in active production.
Our timeline is to get a stable, feature complete alpha version in September 2010, and to have polished library (1.0) ready for January 2011.
