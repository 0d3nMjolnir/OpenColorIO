|OpenColorIO| (|OCIO|) is a new open source project from |Sony Imageworks|.

Based on development started in 2003, |OCIO| enables color transforms and image
display to be handled in a consistent manner across multiple graphics
applications. Unlike other color management solutions, |OCIO| is geared towards
motion-picture post production, with an emphasis on visual effects and animation
color pipelines.
